# Webhooks

### Overview

This is a starter app that is to be used with the Plaid and Webhooks [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E0KEAVeDyc). It implements a very basic version of a Plaid-powered application using HTML/VanillaJS on the front end, and NodeJS/Express on the backend.

### Running the app

- [ ] Clone the repo.
- [ ] Run `npm i`.
- [ ] Create `.env` like the `.env.template` and copy `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` & `PLAID_SECRET` from the Plaid Dashboard. `PLAID_ENV` should remain as sandbox.
- [ ] For the `WEBHOOK_URL` we can set this to anything to begin we can change this later.
- [ ] Run `npm run watch` it should start running on PORT 8000.
